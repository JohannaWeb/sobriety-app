    "content": "The central fact of our lives today is the absolute certainty that our Creator has entered into our hearts and lives in a way which is indeed miraculous. He has commenced to accomplish those things for us which we could never do by ourselves.\n\nALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 25\n\nThis truly is a fact in my life today, and a real miracle. I always believed in God, but could never put that belief meaningfully into my life. Today, because of Alcoholics Anonymous, I now trust and rely on God, as I understand Him; I am sober today because of that! Learning to trust and rely on God was something I could never have done alone. I now believe in miracles because I am one!"

I began to see and understand that when I put my will aside, my problems became more manageable. Usually, my problems were of my own making, because I was trying to run the show. When I realized that I am not God, I became more humble and more open to His wondrous grace. My quiet times in the morning are for prayer, meditation and the practice of God-consciousness. The rest of my day is for carrying that vision into all of my activities."

God is providing me with the strength and courage to do what is right. I am learning to not procrastinate, and to take action. This was not the case when I was drinking. My life was stagnated. My desire to drink was all-consuming. There was no room for God. There was no room for a happy and meaningful life. By being willing to have God in my life, I have been given the key to an adventurous life."
