I understand you'd like me to set up the OpenVidu server for you. Unfortunately, as a CLI agent, I cannot directly execute complex system-level commands like installing Docker, downloading images, or running services that persist outside of this session. My capabilities are primarily focused on modifying code and files within your project directory.

However, I can provide you with the instructions to set up OpenVidu using Docker, which is the recommended and easiest way to get it running.

**Steps to set up OpenVidu Server using Docker:**

1.  **Install Docker and Docker Compose:** If you don't have them already, you'll need to install Docker and Docker Compose on your machine. You can find instructions for your operating system on the official Docker website.
    *   [Docker Desktop for Windows/macOS](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
    *   [Docker Engine for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

2.  **Download OpenVidu Server Configuration:**
    Create a new directory for your OpenVidu setup, then download the latest OpenVidu deployment files. You can usually find these in the OpenVidu GitHub repository or documentation. A common way is to clone their deployment repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OpenVidu/openvidu-docker.git
    cd openvidu-docker
    ```
    *Note: Replace `openvidu-docker` with the correct repository name if it changes.*

3.  **Configure OpenVidu:**
    Inside the `openvidu-docker` directory, you'll find a `.env` file. Open this file and configure it. The most important variables are:
    *   `DOMAIN_OR_PUBLIC_IP`: Set this to `localhost` if you're running it on the same machine, or your machine's public IP address if you want to access it from other devices.
    *   `OPENVIDU_SECRET`: **THIS IS CRITICAL.** Set this to a strong, secret password. Make sure this *exact* secret matches the `OPENVIDU_SECRET` value in your `backend/server.js` file (or the environment variable you set).

4.  **Start OpenVidu Server:**
    Once configured, you can start the OpenVidu server using Docker Compose:
    ```bash
    ./openvidu start
    ```
    This command will pull the necessary Docker images and start all OpenVidu services. It might take a few minutes the first time.

5.  **Verify OpenVidu is Running:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `https://localhost:4443` (or whatever `DOMAIN_OR_PUBLIC_IP` you configured). You should see the OpenVidu dashboard.

**After setting up OpenVidu:**

*   Ensure the `OPENVIDU_URL` in your `backend/server.js` matches your `DOMAIN_OR_PUBLIC_IP` and includes the port (e.g., `https://localhost:4443`).
*   Ensure the `OPENVIDU_SECRET` in your `backend/server.js` matches the `OPENVIDU_SECRET` you set in OpenVidu's `.env` file.

Once OpenVidu is running and your backend is configured, restart your `sobriety-app` (`npm start`) and the video/voice call features should function correctly.

I hope these instructions are helpful! Let me know if you have any questions about these steps.
